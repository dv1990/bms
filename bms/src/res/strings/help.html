    <h2>How to run this program</h2>
    <h3>Readme before you tear apart your PC</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Connect Arduino via USB to the PC</li>
        <li>Click on the .jar package or start the .jar via the command <code>java
            -Xmx128m -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar
            bms.jar</code></li>
        <li>The software automatically connects to the first Arduino it
            detects, so make sure there is only one Arduino
            connected to you PC
        </li>
    </ol>

<div>
    <h2>Battery pack visualizer</h2>
    <h3>Shows data of single cells of segments</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Left mouse click on a cell shows the <strong>real time plot of
            temperature and voltage of single
            cell</strong></li>
        <li>Right mouse click on a cell shows the <strong>real time plot of
            temperature and voltage of all cells in the
            segment it belongs</strong></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Logging window</h2>
    <h3>Shows logs coming from Arduino</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Left mouse click on the window <strong>sets the window to

        <li>Right mouse click on the window <strong>sets autoscroll
            off</strong></li>
    </ol>
